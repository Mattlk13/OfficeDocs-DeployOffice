# Windows Server end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Microsoft 365 Apps on older, unsupported operating systems may cause performance and reliability issues over time. These issues could include new features added to Microsoft 365 Apps, or updates to existing features, not working as expected.
